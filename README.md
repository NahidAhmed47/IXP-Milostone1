1. What is semantic tag?
Ans: Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. On the other hand, tags like<div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements.
