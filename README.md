1. What is semantic tag?
Ans: Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For example, tags like '< header >', '< article >', and '< footer >' are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. On the other hand, tags like '< div >' and '< span >' are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements.

2. What is inline elements?
Ans: Inline elements, in the context of HTML and CSS, refer to elements that flow within the content and do not create new block-level boxes or line breaks. They are used to style and structure smaller parts of the content within a larger block-level structure. Inline elements are often used to apply formatting, links, emphasis, or other minor modifications to the text.

3. What is Block elements? 
Ans: Block elements, in the context of HTML and CSS, refer to elements that create new block-level boxes in the layout and often start on a new line. They are used to define larger structural components of a web page and create clear separations between different sections of content. Block-level elements are commonly used to structure the overall layout and hierarchy of a webpage.

4. What is HTML attributes? 
Ans: In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), attributes are used to provide additional information about elements. Attributes are added to the opening tag of an HTML element and are used to modify the behavior or appearance of the element.
